# Web Development : Zero to Mastery

## Traceroute

> Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on an IP network from source to destination, reporting the IP addresses of all the routers it pinged in between. Traceroute also records the time taken for each hop the packet makes during its route to the destination.
> 
> **If you see ***** (asterisk) in your output:** If a packet is not acknowledged within the expected timeout (5 seconds), an asterisk is displayed. Sometimes this can be due to your internet connection or traceroute  may show ****  because of widespread use of firewalls and other security practices by the company that owns that server.

Sample command:

`traceroute google.com`

## Factors affecting performance of a website
>
> - *Location of Server*
>  
>   Number of hops from client to server depends upon the location of server
> - *How Many Trips between client and server (so how many files)*
> 
>   Less files we have, less number of trips back-and-forth between client and server
> - *Size of Files (HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.)*
> 
>   Size of files is directly proptional to performance of the website

## History of Internet

> - Sir Tim Bernes-Lee invented the World Wide Web(WWW) in 1989
> - He created the very first website
> - He gave a common language(protocol) for machines to talk over network

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript

> Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
> 
> Common to all browsers
> 
> Front End Development: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript + React
> 
> Back End Development: NodeServer (Node.js, Express.js) and DataBase (PostgressSQL, MongoDB)
