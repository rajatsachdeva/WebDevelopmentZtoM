### DOCTYPE tag

> All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
> 
> The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
> 
> In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
> 
> `<!DOCTYPE html>`

### h1 to h6 tag

> The `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags are used to define HTML headings.
> 
> `<h1>` defines the most important heading
> 
> `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

### p (paragraph) tag

> The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph
> 
> Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each `<p>` element.

### b and i tags

> bold and italics tags (mostly deprecated), not compatible with new machines

### strong and em (emphasis) tags

> same as bold and italics respectively, compatible with new devices

### ol and ul tag

> The `<ol>` tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical.
> 
> The `<ul>` tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list.
> 
> The `<li>` tag is used to define each list item.

### Self closing tags

### br tag

> break tag (line break)

### hr tag

> horizontal line

### img tag

> The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
> 
> Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
> 
> The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:
> 
> **src** - Specifies the path to the image
> 
> **alt** - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

### a (Anchor) tag

> The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
> 
> The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the `href` (hypertext reference) attribute,
> which indicates the link's destination.
> 
> By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
> 
> - An unvisited link is underlined and blue
> - A visited link is underlined and purple
> - An active link is underlined and red

### Q & A

- Why first HTML page is named as `index.html`
  
> Ideally first page can be named as anything you like.
> But common practice is to use index.html as the first page by most of the servers.

- Absolute Path vs Relative Path

> A relative path assumes that the file is on the current server. Using relative paths allows you to construct your site offline and fully test it before uploading it. An absolute path refers to a file on the Internet using its full URL. Absolute paths tell the browser precisely where to go.
