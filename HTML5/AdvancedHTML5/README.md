# Advanced HTML5

## form tag

> The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.
>
> The `<form>` element can contain one or more of the following form elements:
>
> - `<input>`
> - `<textarea>`
> - `<button>`
> - `<select>`
> - `<option>`
> - `<optgroup>`
> - `<fieldset>`
> - `<label>`
> - `<output>`
>
> The method attribute specifies how to send form-data (the form-data is sent to the page specified in the action attribute).
>
> The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with `method="get"`) or as HTTP post transaction (with `method="post"`).
>
> ### Notes on GET
>
> Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs. The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters).
>
> Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL).
> Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
>
> GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
>
> ### Notes on POST
>
> Appends form-data inside the body of the `HTTP` request (data is not shown in URL
>
> Has no size limitations
> Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
>
> ### div tag
>
> The `<div>` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
>
> The `<div>` tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
>
> The `<div>` tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
> Any sort of content can be put inside the `<div>` tag!
>
> **Note:** By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the `<div>` element.
>
> ### span tag
>
> The `<span>` tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
>
> The `<span>` tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
>
> The `<span>` tag is much like the `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element and `<span>` is an inline element.
